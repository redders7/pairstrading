# Pairs Trading
Pairs Trading is a well known quantitative trading strategy used by many investors. It is a market neutral strategy where traders hedge against market movements by taking advantage of mean-reversion behavior between a pair of assets (Fallahpour et al., 2016). It consists of several approaches, including the distance, cointegration and time series approaches. This project will focus on the cointegration approach.
